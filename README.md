# bokeh-camera

If you think the Google/Zoom segmentation-based background blur effects look kind of fake, this attempts to simulate a more realistic-looking bokeh using a RealSense D455 camera on a virtual camera device that you can use from any conferencing software.

Work in progress, code not yet cleaned up, but roughly:

1. Build requirements:

   * librealsense2-dev
   * libopencv-dev
   * cmake
   * g++ (or similar C++ compiler)

1. Run `./build-this`

1. Set up a v4l2 loopback device at `/dev/video20`

   ```
   sudo modprobe -r v4l2loopback
   sudo modprobe v4l2loopback devices=1 video_nr=20 exclusive_caps=1
   ```

1. Run `./BokehCamera

1. Select the virtual camera on Google Meet or Zoom or whatever you use

# Controls

While it is running:

Press 1 to send bokeh-fied image

Press 2 to send a map of the computed amount of blur (white = don't blur, black = full blur)

Press 3 to send the depth map

Press 4 to send no-bokeh RGB

Press \[ or \] to refocus the image

**Will it work on a D435/D415/L515?**

Not yet but go ahead and hack at it
